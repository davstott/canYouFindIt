canYouFindIt
============

A solution to the 2013 GCHQ competiition Can You Find It (dot co dot uk)

This 45ish slide presentation covers each of the questions in some detail as well as just enough statistics to help us choose the correct decryption key.

It includes the results of some simple language models I've built using code in my other repository, davsFilters.  Some day I'll write it up.

The source directory includes screenshots of the original web pages and copies of just the competition files, just in case they disappear from the internet completely.

The solutions directory includes the woefully uncommented python snippets I used.
